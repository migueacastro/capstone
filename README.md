# Cinema App | Capstone CS50W

# Overview

This is the capstone project I made for CS50W. In this project I have developed
a full stack web application that can be used by a Cinema Company to address
session booking in the user's side and the resource managment in the staff/admin dashboard.

# Distinctiveness and Complexity

I highly consider that this project satisfies and even overflows in complexity because of the use of Django REST Framework
and Svelte, different Javascript framework than React, which, while serving as an alternative with many differences, also makes the front-end rendering faster and it is also used Skeleton UI, a UI library that allows the interface to have more uniform styles throughout the components being based of Tailwind CSS library, which is also an alternative for Bootstrap but still making the page fully responsive for mobile devices. Moreover, the front-end includes charts that are based on Carbon Charts library.

As for Django, it is implemented the Django-Q module, which makes scheduling daily tasks possible as for the creation of sessions, also for the session seats selection a websocket module has been implemented, Django channels, which through its consumers, it allows the web applicaton to perfom real time page updates based on signals sent and received from the front and backend, allowing users to check if a seat has been already selected or not in the room which the session will be.

Altogether, it sets a substantial difference from all of the course projects and the user side is based on many cinema websites, however, the dashboard has been fully designed for the project's needs.

### üìë Project requirements

- [x] Your web application must be sufficiently distinct from the other projects in this course (and, in addition, may not be based on the old CS50W Pizza project), and more complex than those: This project is highly different than the previous CS50W projects and aims for another level of complexity.
       
- [x] Your web application must utilize Django (including at least one model) on the back-end and JavaScript on the front-end: This project uses Django REST framework for the backend including 16 custom models. It uses Svelte, a JavaScript framework on the front-end.
- [x] Your web application must be mobile-responsive: The project application is totally responsive.
